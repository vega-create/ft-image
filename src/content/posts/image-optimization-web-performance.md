Images typically account for 50-80% of a webpage total size. Optimizing them is one of the most impactful things you can do for web performance.

## Why Image Optimization Matters

Slower page loads directly impact user experience and business metrics. Studies show that a one-second delay in page load time can reduce conversions by 7%. Google uses page speed as a ranking factor, making image optimization important for SEO as well.

## Choosing the Right Format

### JPEG

Best for photographs and images with many colors. JPEG uses lossy compression, meaning some quality is sacrificed for smaller file sizes. Quality settings between 75-85% usually provide a good balance. Use our Image Compressor to find the right quality level.

### PNG

Best for images that need transparency, screenshots, and graphics with text or sharp edges. PNG uses lossless compression, preserving all image data. PNG files are typically larger than JPEG for photographs.

### WebP

A modern format that provides both lossy and lossless compression with smaller file sizes than JPEG and PNG. Supported by all modern browsers. Consider converting your images to WebP for additional savings.

### SVG

Best for icons, logos, and simple illustrations. SVG files are resolution-independent and typically very small. Use our SVG to PNG converter when you need a raster version.

## Practical Optimization Steps

Resize images to the maximum display size needed. A 4000px wide image displayed at 800px wastes bandwidth. Use our Image Resizer to set exact dimensions. Compress images to reduce file size without visible quality loss. Use responsive images with srcset to serve appropriate sizes for different devices.
