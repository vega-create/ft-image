Choosing between JPG and PNG affects image quality, file size, and functionality. Each format has specific strengths that make it ideal for certain types of images.

## JPEG (JPG) Format

JPEG uses lossy compression, discarding some image data to achieve smaller file sizes. This makes it ideal for photographs where slight quality loss is imperceptible. JPEG files are significantly smaller than PNG for photo-type images.

### When to Use JPG

Use JPG for photographs, images with gradients or many colors, social media images, and any image where small file size matters more than pixel-perfect quality.

### JPG Limitations

JPEG does not support transparency. Each time you save a JPEG, some quality is lost (generation loss). JPEG struggles with sharp edges, text, and flat color areas, often creating visible artifacts.

## PNG Format

PNG uses lossless compression, preserving all image data perfectly. It supports transparency (alpha channel), making it essential for images that need to overlay other content.

### When to Use PNG

Use PNG for logos, icons, screenshots, images with text, graphics with sharp edges, and any image requiring transparency.

### PNG Limitations

PNG files are larger than JPEG for photographs. There is no quality slider since compression is lossless. For very large images, PNG file sizes can become impractical.

## Quick Decision Guide

Is it a photograph? Use JPG. Does it need transparency? Use PNG. Is it a screenshot or graphic? Use PNG. Does file size matter most? Use JPG. Need perfect quality? Use PNG. Our PNG to JPG and JPG to PNG converters make it easy to switch between formats.
