Every 3 bytes of binary data become 4 characters of Base64 text. This means Base64 encoded data is about 33% larger than the original binary.\n\n## When to Use Base64\n\n### Small Images and Icons\n\nFor images under 2-3 KB, the overhead of an HTTP request often exceeds the cost of the larger Base64 string. Embedding small icons and decorative elements as Base64 can improve performance.\n\n### Single-File Documents\n\nWhen you need everything in one HTML file (email templates, exported reports, offline documents), Base64 images eliminate external dependencies.\n\n### CSS Background Images\n\nSmall background patterns and UI elements can be embedded directly in CSS files, reducing HTTP requests.\n\n## When Not to Use Base64\n\nDo not Base64 encode large images. The 33% size increase plus the inability to cache separately makes this counterproductive for anything over a few kilobytes.\n\nDo not use Base64 for images that appear on multiple pages.

While not foolproof protection, watermarks deter casual theft and help with attribution.\n\n## Types of Watermarks\n\n### Text Watermarks\n\nThe simplest approach adds your name, website, or copyright notice to the image. Text watermarks are easy to create and clearly communicate ownership. Our Image Watermark tool lets you add customizable text watermarks.\n\n### Logo Watermarks\n\nUsing your logo as a watermark adds professional branding. Logo watermarks work well for commercial photography and stock images.\n\n### Invisible Watermarks\n\nDigital watermarks embedded in the image data are invisible to viewers but can be detected with special software. These are used by stock photo agencies and news organizations.\n\n## Placement Strategy\n\nCorner placement is less intrusive but easier to crop out. Center placement provides better protection but may detract from the image. Diagonal across the image offers the most protection.\n\n## Opacity and Size\n\nWatermarks should be visible enough to deter theft but not so prominent that they ruin the image. An opacity of 30-50% usually works well. Size should be large enough that removing it would noticeably degrade the image.\n\n## Best Practices\n\nAlways keep unwatermarked originals stored safely. Apply watermarks as the last step before publishing. Use consistent watermark style across all your images for brand recognition. Consider different watermark strengths for different uses, with lighter marks for portfolio display and stronger marks for social media sharing.","src/content/posts/image-watermark-protection-guide.md","4e0e9df0fc7d438a",{"html":241,"metadata":242},"\u003Cp>Watermarking adds a visible mark to your images that identifies you as the creator or owner.
